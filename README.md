# regression-machine-learning
In this project, I solved several tasks applying regression. 

## Linear Regression
For the first one, we need to try different regression models to fill the missing values in each feature with a regression model for each of them. 

## Logisitc Regression
For the second task, we will explore a dataset of email spam and train logistic regression to find junk email, and finally, conclude features that influence the decision the most.
